Description
===========

Play Panopticon and become a data controler! build your data empire, the tallest tower from which to view the entire internet and control how content and personal data moves. You may have good intentions, or bad ones. Behind the virtual air we breathe are the people who control us – the battle for data and people’s very identities is being fought. What will YOU choose to do?

Game for 3-6 players. playing time approx 1hr

Setting up
==========

You will need the following items for the game:

3 – 6 players 

A circular panopticon board 

Spinner – made up of 6 colour positions 

Power up handhelds ( put list here) 

10 coloured 2×2 lego bricks per player in a bag 

6 Player mission cards (bad hacker, good hacker, trojan, anti-virus, activist, NGO ) 

Per player:
-----------
* 1 lego mini figure 
* 1 identity crystal 
* 6 personal data blocks (1×2 bricks) 
* base board (min 8 x 10 lego board) 
* 3 ability cards (single square brick/cylinders) 

Preparing the board
-------------------
Depending on the number of players – draw or otherwise mark equal ‘ranges’ from the middle to the edge of the board so that each player has an equal slice of the board.Put all the power up tools in the middle of the board and the spinner on the side of the board. Each player takes one player mission card without telling anyone what the mission is.

Players prepare their Panopticon bases. Each player takes a base board, picks a mini figure in turn and 3 ability cards. Take 6 personal data blocks and arrange them into a defensive wall in front of your identity crystal. Put your mini-figure and put it in front of the wall. Put your base board in the centre of the board so that your character faces outwards

Choosing your data
------------------

In turn – pick 10 coloured data pieces without looking from the bag of bits. As you draw out the bits – put them on the board in the following circles within your range – your field of vision.
* first ring: 1 bits 
* second ring: 2 bits 
* third ring: 3 bits 
* fourth ring: 4 bits 

Start of play
=============

Youngest player takes the first turn.
Spin the spinner. You need to ‘get’ a block of that colour from the board. You can only look inside your own range at the first circle. If you have that colour – take it and put it on your base board and put your mini figure on top of it. This is the start of your Panopticon tower.

Your vision with 1 block on your tower now extends to the second circle within your range.
If you don’t have the right colour and someone else does – you can make a deal. Ask the player with your coloured block in their first circle to give you theirs. The player you ask can give it to you for free, trade theirs for yours or can ask you for a personal data block for it.

If no player has that colour – move onto the next player to your left. Repeat as before.
After spinning, you can choose to play one of your ability cards and make any trade you need to help you get closer to your mission.

If you tower gets 2 blocks tall your vision now extends to the third circle. With 3 blocks it extends to 4th (last) circle. Put your mini figure on top as you get taller. You must put your blocks in order that you get them.

Winning the game
================

The winner of the game is the person who reaches their mission first.

Leaving the game / loosing control
----------------------------------

You can leave the game – or give over control of everything you have if your tower collapses or you choose to knock it down. You must then select which player to give your tower, mini-figure, personal data and id crystals to. If you choose you can stay involved in the game by commenting and making ‘helpful’ suggestions to other players.

If your ID crystal is stolen you carry on playing but are controled by the thief until end of game or until someone returns it to you.

Aquiring a tower
----------------

If someone gives you control of their data and figure – you need to put the tower blocks and personal data on your own board either on top of your own tower or beside it. You can rearrange your board however you want at this point. From now on you have 2 turns every spin – one for each minifigure.

* Blue (water) = money 
* Red (fire) = downloads/consumer products 
* Green (earth) = social media 
* Yellow (tech) = software and tools 
* Black (undead) = black/grey market 
* White (air) = information
